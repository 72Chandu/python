TensorFlow is an open-source framework for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) 
It was designed to facilitate the development of machine learning models, particularly deep learning models by providing tools to easily build, train and deploy them across different platforms.

Tensors: Tensors are the fundamental units of data in TensorFlow. They are multi-dimensional arrays or matrices used for storing data. A tensor can have one dimension (vector), two dimensions (matrix) or more dimensions.

Graph: A TensorFlow graph represents a computation as a flow of tensors through a series of operations. Each operation in the graph performs a specific mathematical function on the input tensors such as matrix multiplication, addition or activation.

Session: A session in TensorFlow runs the computation defined by the graph and evaluates the tensors. This is where the actual execution of the model happens enabling the training and inference processes.



Step 1: Train a Model

Use TensorFlow to build and train a machine learning model on platform like a PC or cloud.
Employ datasets relevant to your application like images, text, sensor data, etc.
Evaluate and validate the model to ensure high accuracy before deployment.

Step 2: Convert the Model
Convert the trained model into TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) format using the TFLite Converter.
This conversion prepares the model for resource-constrained edge environments.
Supports different formats like saved models, Keras models or concrete functions.

Step 3: Optimize the Model
Apply model optimization techniques such as quantization, pruning or weight clustering.
Reduces the model size, improves inference speed and minimizes memory footprint.
Crucial for running models efficiently on mobile, embedded or microcontroller devices.

Step 4: Deploy the Model
Deploy the optimized .tflite model to edge devices like Android, iOS, Linux-based embedded systems like Raspberry Pi and Microcontrollers like Arm Cortex-M.
Ensure compatibility with TensorFlow Lite runtime for the target platform.

Step 5: Make Inferences at the Edge
Run real-time predictions directly on the edge device using the TFLite Interpreter.
Enables low-latency, offline inference without relying on cloud computation.
Supports use cases like image recognition, voice detection and sensor data analysis.
